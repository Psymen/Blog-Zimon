It's been pretty difficult to work on the website recently since I've been at Deloitte University for training. It's an amazing facility. Anyways, I'm really excited right now because not only did I finally get Disqus to work on my site, I also managed to:

1) Remote Map through Sublime Text
2) Get Jekyll to watch automatically for changes in the server

These two things combined means I can finally just edit things on my laptop and see the changes immediately on the web. Yes!!

Well, it's 1:04 AM now and I still have massive amounts of work to do for my Deloitte Simulation Training. Adios!]
