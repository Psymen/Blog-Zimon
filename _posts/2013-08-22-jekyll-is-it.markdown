Well, I've decided to go with `Jekyll` for my blog. It's really the perfect solution, and it works will with bootstrap which is great. Since I've been back to the US jetlag has been owning me so I've actually had a bit of time to code since I'm awake while nobody else is. I'll write more detailed posts later, for now, I'm just going to try and get the site up.
