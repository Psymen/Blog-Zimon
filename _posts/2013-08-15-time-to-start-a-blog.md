Well, it's been awhile since I've tried to get back into the blogosphere. I decided building a blog would be a good way to dig up those web-programming skills. Since I'm in China with pretty slow internet, I'll probably just do some research right now into how I want to make my blog. I'm mostly looking for a platform that's responsive and serves static pages. After all, a blog doesn't need a full CMS right? We'll see!
