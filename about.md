Hi! I'm Simon Tiu (pronounced a lot like "two"). 

I'm a nerd, interested in many things and skilled in a few. I've made this blog to track some of my main interests. I've just started a job at Deloitte Consulting, so I'm not sure how much time I'll have hack on this website. 

I'm interested in all things China. I'm Chinese but grew up speaking only English. After serving a mission for my church for 2 years speaking Spanish, I decided it was time to get back to my roots and learn Chinese! 

I'm interested in all things data (especially unstructured data). The notion that we can predict human behavior through brute force is fascinating on an existential level.

I'm interested in all things Mormon. It's weird being a Mormon, a Chinese Mormon at that. I love philosophy and questioning the basic tenets. I'll be writing about being a Mormon in terms of today.
