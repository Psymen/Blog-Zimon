  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been pretty difficult to work on the website recently since I&amp;#8217;ve been at Deloitte University for training. It&amp;#8217;s an amazing facility. Anyways, I&amp;#8217;m really excited right now because not only did I finally get Disqus to work on my site, I also managed to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Remote Map through Sublime Text
2) Get Jekyll to watch automatically for changes in the server&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two things combined means I can finally just edit things on my laptop and see the changes immediately on the web. Yes!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;#8217;s 1:04 AM now and I still have massive amounts of work to do for my Deloitte Simulation Training. Adios!]&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to go with &lt;code&gt;Jekyll&lt;/code&gt; for my blog. It&amp;#8217;s really the perfect solution, and it works will with bootstrap which is great. Since I&amp;#8217;ve been back to the US jetlag has been owning me so I&amp;#8217;ve actually had a bit of time to code since I&amp;#8217;m awake while nobody else is. I&amp;#8217;ll write more detailed posts later, for now, I&amp;#8217;m just going to try and get the site up.&lt;/p&gt;
